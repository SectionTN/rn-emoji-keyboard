# Translations

It would be great if you could contribute your translations! You can do it by following this steps
_You can use `en` everywhere as reference_

- Create language file in `/src/translation/` directory. _For example `en.ts`_
- Create a translation object like in other languages
  - _remember to change object name per your language_
- Import and export this file in `/src/index.tsx` file.
- Add a new language to documentation in `README.md file`.
